For each module, the README file must identify the lead developer and the contributors.
The leads should be evenly divided among the group members.

### Prerequisites

Java Developer Kit 8 is required running on Linux, Windows or Mac.
Maven 3 is also required.

To confirm that you have them installed, open a terminal and type:

```
javac -version

mvn -version
```


### Installing

To compile and install all modules:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

The tests are skipped because they require each server to be running.


## Built With
